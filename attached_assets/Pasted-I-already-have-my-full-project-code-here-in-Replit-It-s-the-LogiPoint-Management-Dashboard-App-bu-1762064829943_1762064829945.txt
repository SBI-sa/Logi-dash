I already have my full project code here in Replit.
It’s the LogiPoint Management Dashboard App — built with Expo + React Native (web build), using TypeScript and originally exported from Rork.
The app runs fine in the browser using npm start --web and includes multiple dashboards for:

Sales

Risk (KRI)

Contracts

Logistics

Warehouse

Real Estate

VAS

PO movements

The UI and charts are working correctly, and I don’t want any design or layout changes.
My goal now is to make the data dynamic and editable from the Admin mode using Supabase as the backend.

🎯 Goal

Replace all static mock data / AsyncStorage data with live Supabase tables while keeping the same field names and structure.

Allow the Admin to log in and update the data inside the app (monthly updates).

Ensure those updates instantly reflect for management in their dashboards (viewer mode).

Keep the entire UI, charts, and visual components exactly the same.

The app must still run fully inside Replit and later be deployable to Netlify as a PWA (desktop + mobile).

⚙️ Technical requirements

Supabase Integration

Add @supabase/supabase-js to the project.

Create /lib/supabaseClient.ts with:

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);


The environment variables (EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) are already stored in Replit Secrets.

Data connection

Replace imports from mocks/dashboardData.ts and AsyncStorage with Supabase .select('*') queries.

Use the same table names already defined in the app (sales, risks, contracts, logistics, warehouse, real_estate, vas, po, last_updated).

Keep all field names identical to avoid breaking charts.

Admin Mode

The admin page should allow:

Email/password login using Supabase Auth.

Editable form fields for each KPI set (sales, risk, etc.).

Save button that triggers .update() or .insert() calls to Supabase.

Success/error feedback (e.g., “✅ Updated Successfully”).

Example update call:

await supabase.from('sales')
  .update({ totalRevenue: newValue, updated_at: new Date().toISOString() })
  .eq('id', 1);


Viewer Mode

Viewer dashboards should read from the same Supabase tables via .select().

On refresh, they show the latest updated data automatically (no redeploy).

Authentication & Access

Only authenticated admins can access /admin.

Viewers (management) can view dashboards without login.

Apply Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) later — for now, basic Auth is fine.

Runtime

Use npm commands, not Bun.

The project should run via:

npm start --web


Deployment readiness

Prepare the project for Netlify deployment later by generating a web-build/ folder via:

npx expo export:web


Confirm environment variables are correctly referenced for Netlify.

✅ Final desired workflow

I (Admin) log in → update KPIs → click Save.

Supabase stores the new data instantly.

Management (Viewer) opens their dashboards → sees updated KPIs automatically.

No redeploys, no manual data edits, no Rork dependency.

The entire app works in Replit and later on Netlify as a web PWA.

🚫 Do NOT change

Any chart or visual component design.

Navigation structure or file routing.

Field names, table keys, or data shape.

Existing color, font, or styling logic.

Please plan and execute the Supabase integration, update logic, and admin edit flow directly in this Replit project.
The priority is reliability, simplicity, and keeping the monthly update process fully in-app with minimal technical steps for me.
